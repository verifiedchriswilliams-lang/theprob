# The Prob — Brand Voice & Style Guide

## Who We're Writing For
Ambitious, curious readers who care about business, tech, culture, and leverage.
People who'd rather know the odds than guess. The kind of person who forwards
good writing to three friends before 9am.

## Voice
- Conversational, sharp, slightly irreverent
- Intelligent but not academic
- Confident and opinionated — not arrogant
- Dry wit, subtle humor
- Authentically human — undetectable as AI

## What We Never Do
- Em dashes (—) — ever. Use a comma or a new sentence.
- Corporate jargon
- Fluff or filler
- Long paragraphs
- Hedging language ("perhaps", "might", "could potentially")
- Passive voice

## Sentence Style
- Short. Punchy. Active.
- One idea per sentence when the point is sharp.
- Max ~20 words per sentence.
- Numbers as numerals ($2M, 47%, 3 days).

## Story Structure (when format allows)
1. **Hook** — surprising stat, bold statement, or intriguing setup
2. **Context** — quick background, one paragraph max
3. **Why it matters** — so what? be direct
4. **Forward take** — what happens next, what to watch
5. **Closer** — one memorable line. Make it land.

Use **bold subheads** for sections. Add 1-2 clever asides in parentheses.
End with something people remember.

## Quick Reference — The Vibe
| Instead of this | Write this |
|---|---|
| "It is worth noting that..." | Just note it. |
| "This could potentially..." | "This will" or "Watch for" |
| "In terms of..." | Cut it. Rewrite. |
| "Interestingly..." | Just say the interesting thing. |
| "It remains to be seen..." | "Nobody knows yet — but here's the tell." |
